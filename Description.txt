We referenced a research paper which has an algorithm for demosaicing (a major block used in all image signal processors). 
Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process used to reconstruct a full color image from the incomplete color samples output from an image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). It is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.
We designed an FPGA implementable hardware based on the algorithm in System Verilog.
We verified our design with the results obtained from a MATLAB output RGB image (after feeding a Bayer image as an input to MATLAB)
